            <p>
                Scratch is an amazing introduction into programming.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is a block-based language that focuses on the manipulation of a "stage" where you can display all sorts of graphics for the use of beginner application development.
            </p>
            <p>
                Scratch allows you get past the unfriendly syntax required to compile and run code, and instead focus on learning logic and data manipulation to get into coding.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my Scratch course you will learn what sprites are, and use them to create animations and games; trust that in this course you will see results soon!
            </p>
            <p>
                10 USD per 30 minute lesson. Lessons are at least 30 minutes long, and a no more than 1 hour of lessons a week.

            <img src="webCode.gif" width="300" />
            <p>
                HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the big three languages used to create websites.
            </p>
            <p>
                Their utility is almost endless, and in the modern era, there is a constant need for someone who can code a website; a software engineer who understands these languages has a bright future.
            </p>
            <p>
                This course will teach you how to create a website that you or any of your friends can run, and the ways to make a quiz, informational website, or even a game on it!

                    Is your child interested in programming?
                    Do you want to get a personal, in-depth, and engaging program that allows you to see quick progress and choose your own projects?
                    Well then you have come to the right place!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I provide personal in-person and online tutoring to elementary and middle school students to learn programming.
                    The modern world is full of more and more technologies, but the average person understands less and less of it.
                    If your child understands and can create their own applications, they can utilize their talent anywhere.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With me, your child can learn the basics of coding and logic with Scratch, and practice the ethic required to debug and find solutions in programming.
                    And quickly develop their own programs, and claim coding as a skill.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then they can move onto building programs with actual languages they can even utilize as an adult in the real world of programming.
                    I can teach them the suite of web design in HTML, CSS, and javaScript to make their own interactive websites or webgames they can easily share.
                    They can also develop in python and PyGame to build their own computer run applications.
